#### Abstract:

Ad-hoc wireless sensor network is an architecture of connected nodes; each node has its main elements such as sensors, computation and communications capabilities. Ad-hoc WSNs restrained energy sources result in a shorter lifetime of the sensor network and inefficient topology. In this paper, a new approach for saving and energy controlling is introduced using quality of service. The main reason is to reduce the nodeâ€™s energy through discovering the best optimum route that meets QoS requirements; QoS technique is used to find the optimum methodology for nodes packets transmission and energy consumption. The primary goals of the research are to discover the best techniques to 1) Minimize the total consumed energy in the ad hoc wireless sensor network. 2) Maximize the ad hoc wireless sensor network lifetime. The simulations of the problem will be formulated with the use of Integer Linear Programming


## MATLAB Code

The MATLAB code within this repository implements the methodologies detailed in the research paper. The primary script, `ex2.m`, serves as a practical demonstration of the optimization process for wireless sensor networks. It utilizes a fixed topology generated by `topology_generation3.m` and the `reqBank4` function to generate request data.
