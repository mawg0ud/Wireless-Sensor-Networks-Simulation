The architecture of an ad-hoc wireless sensor network is made up of nodes that are connected to each other. Each node has its own main parts, such as sensors, computing, and communication tools. Ad-hoc WSNs with limited energy sources have sensor networks that work less well and last less long. In this project, quality of service is used to show a new way to save money and control energy use.

The main reason is to save energy by finding the best route that meets QoS requirements. The QoS technique is used to find the best way for nodes to send packets and use the least amount of energy. The main goal of the research is to find the best ways to: 1) Use as little energy as possible in the ad hoc wireless sensor network as a whole. 2) Make the wireless sensor network last as long as possible. Integer Linear Programming will be used to come up with the simulations of the problem.
